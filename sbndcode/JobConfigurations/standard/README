The 'standard' fcls in this directory are the usual fcls you would need for the typical downstream stages of the sbnd workflow (g4, detsim, reco, anatree)
The gen directory contains the various production generator-level fcls for producing different samples
The g4, detsim, reco and anatree directories contain override fcls that tweak parameters/features of the simulation/reconstruction e.g. changing the electron lifetime in the g4 simulation.
The workshop directory contains fcls from a past workshop that probably should have been organised elsewhere ;)
The deprecated directory contains fcls that are being retired and no longer recommended.  They should not be used.
